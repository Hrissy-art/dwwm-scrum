							valuable to stakeholders.
							The Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
							For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that
							meets the Definition of Done. </li>
							<li>The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.</li>
